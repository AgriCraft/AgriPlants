## Contact [![contact]][contact-link]
I have a Discord channel where you can contact me for support/suggestions which you don't think fit on this issue tracker. Also if you want to discuss something with me, this is the place to be!


## Bug reports

Please report any and all bugs you might encounter while playing with this mod. Suggestions are also welcome.
However before reporting a bug please update to the latest version of the mod to see if it still persists.
If you want to post bug reports for older versions, make sure to tell me what version you are using and the version of Forge you are using.
If you report a bug and I request more feedback, the label 'Awaiting reply' will be added, if I have had no response for 5 days after adding that label, the issue will be closed.


## Technical Documentation

AgriCraft internals (such as MineTweaker3 integration) are documented here in the GitHub Wiki
([Link](https://github.com/InfinityRaider/AgriCraft/wiki)). Reason is that
this kind of information is, most of the time, only needed by pack creators and not the average user.
